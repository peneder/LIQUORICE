Thank you for your interest in ``LIQUORICE``! ``LIQUORICE`` is a command-line-tool and python package for bias correction and quantification of changes
in coverage around regions of interest in cfDNA WGS datasets. ``LIQUORICE`` can be used to detect and quantify
tissue or cancer-specific epigenetic signatures in liquid biopsies. This allows accurate quantification of the
fraction of tumor-derived cell-free DNA, `as demonstrated in our recent publication <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23445-w>`_.

**We have recently released an improved, updated version of ``LIQUORICE``, which can be found at: <https://liquorice.readthedocs.io>_ and <https://github.com/epigen/LIQUORICE>_.**

The original version of LIQUORICE that was used for our publication (Peneder, St√ºtz et al, Nature Communications 2021) and to which this repository originally linked is described `here <https://medical-epigenomics.org/papers/peneder2020_f17c4e3befc643ffbb31e69f43630748/code/figure5/figure5.html>`_
and is available for download `here <https://medical-epigenomics.org/papers/peneder2020_f17c4e3befc643ffbb31e69f43630748/code/figure5/>`_.
However, we would recommend you to use our `updated version <https://liquorice.readthedocs.io>`__ if you want to use LIQUORICE on your own data.
